# Summary:
### This project is all about applications of Simple Linear Regression to real data using R. The dataset that I will be using contains data about powerlifting stats for individuals competing at powerlifting meets. I will examine the relationship between a personâ€™s weight and the 3 main compound movement exercises: the bench press, the deadlift, and the squat.
